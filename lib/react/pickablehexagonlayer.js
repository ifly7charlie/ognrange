// This class overrides the PathLayer point selection algorithm which normally just
// tells you what line segment is covered. By overriding this we can identify exactly
// what point on the line is hovered/clicked and use that to display information about
// the specific spot on the trace like the time or climb rate.
//
//
// FWIW If a plane has good flarm coverage there will only be one segment as we
// only generate a new segment on gaps. Mapbox recommended one segment for each colour
// but that isn't needed for deckgl binary layers as we can specify a colour per vertex
// if we want. It also means that each segment is rendered as a line and there is no
// joining or smoothing which is less than ideal
//
